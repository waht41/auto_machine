## Core Advantages

### One-Click Installation Experience

- **Standalone Desktop Application**: Built on Electron, providing cross-platform support
- **Zero Configuration Startup**: No environment dependencies or development toolchain required

### Intelligent Interaction Innovation

- **YAML-Driven Toolbox**: Define tool execution logic through standardized format, supporting real-time debugging and auditing
- **Progressive Context Management**: Dynamically load prompt fragments, obtaining key information as needed

### Ready-to-Use Capabilities

- **Intelligent File System Operations**: Support for local file creation, deletion, modification, querying, and automated processing
- **Browser Automation Control**: Web content scraping, form filling, process automation
- **Multi-Step Task Planning**: LLM-based autonomous task decomposition and path optimization

    D --> F[Tool Executor]
```

## Working Principle

1. **Task Parsing**
    AI understands the tool library (file operations/browser control, etc.) through a streamlined initial prompt
2. **Intelligent Decision Making**
    Generates standardized YAML execution instructions:

yaml

Copy

```yaml
tool: file
cmd: download
url: https://www.baidu.com/favicon.ico
path: ./download/favicon.ico
```

3. **Dynamic Execution**
    Backend parses and executes instructions, execution results are fed back in structured format
4. **Continuous Optimization**
    Automatically adjusts strategy based on execution logs, supporting up to 5 iterations of optimization
